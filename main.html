                Legendary assassin John Wick (Keanu Reeves) retired from his
                violent career after marrying the love of his life. Her sudden
                death leaves John in deep mourning. When sadistic mobster Iosef
                Tarasov (Alfie Allen) and his thugs steal John's prized car and
                kill the puppy that was a last gift from his wife, John
                unleashes the remorseless killing machine within and seeks
                vengeance. Meanwhile, Iosef's father (Michael Nyqvist) -- John's
                former colleague -- puts a huge bounty on John's head.
